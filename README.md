Joel and Michael's Machine Learning Code 

In this project, we have decided to learn how Machine Learning works using a previous project a user named CodeBullet created in C#.

ORIGINAL PROJECT IS BY CODEBULLET: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZfhUcNiqk

GitHub to CodeBullet's Work: https://github.com/Code-Bullet/Smart-Dots-Genetic-Algorithm-Tutorial/tree/master/BestTutorialEver

We are transferring this code to Java to understand how Machine Learning works.
Hopefully, once we finish this part, we will create our own game with Machine Learning. :D
